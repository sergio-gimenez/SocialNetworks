# The Small World Theory

The world is dinamyc, everything is dynamic. Let's take a bicycle as an example. A bicycle is a mean of transport that moves us from point A to point B using ower mechanical power to move the wheels through a chain. But now, what if this chain is laying in the floor? Obviously even if you pull the pedals, the bicycle will not move without a chain. 

Now, let's take a closer look at the chain. The chain is a set of dots connected each other that perfectly fits in the bicycle chainring. However, in the _dynamic context_ of the vehicle, the relevance of these connections is quite different. 

The take from here is that in the dynamic context of the bicycle, the _links_ of the chain are imperceptible, but so important. If one fails, all the "_chainring network_" fails. We can find this behaviour in many systems, for example in computers. In programs running in a computer, if a small bug is found in one of the programs, the whole program is affected.

This theory has many applications both interesting and terrrifying, you can do such big changes in a network by just selecting the propper nodes and changing their behavior.
